==============================================
 StudyClock — Custom Audio Alert Files
==============================================

Place your own MP3 recordings in this folder
to replace the browser speech synthesis.

File names (must match exactly):
 - session_start.mp3   → Plays when a study session begins
 - session_end.mp3     → Plays when a study session completes
 - break_start.mp3     → Plays when a break begins
 - break_end.mp3       → Plays when a break ends
 - warning_5min.mp3    → Plays 5 minutes before session ends
 - warning_2min.mp3    → Plays 2 minutes before session ends

If a file is missing, the app falls back to
your browser's built-in text-to-speech voice.

Tips for recordings:
 - Keep files under 3 seconds for alerts
 - Speak clearly at a natural pace
 - Record in a quiet environment
 - Save at 128kbps mp3 quality
